        Embroidery is the craft of decorating fabric or other materials using a
        needle to apply thread or yarn. Embroidery may also incorporate other
        materials such as pearls, beads, quills, and sequins. In modern days,
        embroidery is usually seen on caps, hats, coats, overlays, blankets,
        dress shirts, denim, dresses, stockings, and golf shirts. Embroidery is
        available with a wide variety of thread or yarn colour.

        During quarantine I found at the embroidery a way to distract myself.
        <br />
        I gifted my friends with unique embroideries. <br />
